Cory Chitwood, Eddy Doering, Daoud Haq, and Lucas Mueller

## Introduction:
This project takes the data from the american business survey with an API call and analyzes it with a focus on the states: Washington, Iowa, and Louisiana. Specifically, the focus of this project is on the demographics of businessess in each state along with firm size and factors influencing a firm's longevity.

## Data:
The data was collected from the Census website using their API for the American Business Survey (ABS). To do this we simply needed to register for a key and learn how to call on the appropriate information as neccessary. For further details on how this is done please consult the ETL folder. In the folder you will find a word doc discussing the data set a bit more and links on how to query Census API data in general. Along with the word doc is a jupyter notebook containing the code that was used to extract, transform, and load the census data into python. The notebook also has sections of code that was used to generate visualizations. 

## The Report:
The Report is a file titled "Assesssment 8 Project Report" and contains all of the visuals that were generated while exploring the ABS data as well as explanations of the visuals and their relevance to the report. The purpose of the report was to explore the characteristics of businesses in each state and compare them across Washington, Iowa, and Louisiana.
